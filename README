Our grand plan is to build an app to help a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. Even heroes need to find work.

Of course we'll only make a little progress in this tutorial. What we do build will have many of the features we expect to find in a full-blown, data-driven application: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, editing a selected hero's detail, and navigating among different views of heroic data.

The Tour of Heroes covers the core fundamentals of Angular. We’ll use built-in directives to show/hide elements and display lists of hero data. We’ll create a component to display hero details and another to show an array of heroes. We'll use one-way data binding for read-only data. We'll add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding. We'll bind component methods to user events like key strokes and clicks. We’ll learn to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view. We'll format data with pipes. We'll create a shared service to assemble our heroes. And we'll use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

    We created a reusable component
    We learned how to make a component accept input
    We learned to declare the application directives we need in an Angular module. We list the directives in the NgModule decorator's declarations array.
    We learned to bind a parent component to a child component.
